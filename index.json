Accumulated optimizations and architectural improvements significantly reduce latency, improve layout responsiveness, reduce jitter, and greatly reduce Space Engineers profiler overhead. Highlights Iterative tree update system Rich HUD Master now traverses and updates client UI trees directly via reference handles, eliminating inefficient polling. Core UI state management for v1.3 clients has been centralized in Rich HUD Master, yielding: Near-instant element registration and visibility changes (one-frame latency) 80%+ fewer delegate invocations and lower mod profiler overhead Dramatically reduced cost for UI nodes; invisible but loaded nodes are now essentially free. Build Vision's list menu update time was reduced by 45%. Improved layout stability The standard UI library has been refactored with separate bottom-up Measure and top-down Layout passes. This architectural change eliminates the bouncing and lag previously caused by timing issues and top-down data flow limitations. As a result, self-sizing elements and dynamic containers are now nearly jitter-free. Public API documentation All public APIs and core source code now include expanded inline documentation. A new DocFX-based reference site provides detailed remarks, usage examples, and supplementary materials. Additions Bind Manager Support for bind aliases (secondary and tertiary key combinations) Added analog control and gamepad input support Declarative input utilities BindInputElement, IBindInput, and IBindInputElement – logic-only nodes for context-aware, event-driven input handling, complimenting preexisting layout utilities like HudChain. IValueControls interface with unified value accessors and change callbacks, enabling near-fully declarative custom UI when using library elements with built-in layout utilties. Other Changes Added convenience combinations for DimAlignment and ParentAlignment flags TextBox now supports text highlighting using Shift + arrow keys Input focus management separated from IMouseInput; now handled via dedicated IFocusHandler and InputFocusHandler interfaces Added UnpaddedSize property to HudElementBase HudMain.Root and HudMain.HighDpiRoot now support DimAlignment and ParentAlignment flags on child nodes Breaking Changes (from v1.2.x) Mods that directly modify or depend on internal library implementation will require refactoring. Mods that use public interfaces compositionally are minimally affected. HudElementBase: Width, Height, and Size properties are no longer virtual Selection box and text element value properties renamed to align with IValueControl contract Mouse input focus/active state removed from IMouseInput/MouseInputElement Now managed separately via IFocusHandler, InputFocusHandler, and IFocusableElement IClickableElement implementations must now also implement IFocusableElement BindManager groups can no longer be instantiated directly from deserialized definitions; groups must be declared before loading Preload flag is now obsolete (removed from registration methods) Minor naming adjustments and method relocations in core types The above list is representative but not exhaustive. Consult the API reference as needed for more detail and usage examples.

Library Changes This update is focused on taking advantage of the changes made in SE's billboard API in v1.200, while also including a few bug fixes and minor additions for the UI library. Additions • Added system for handling billboard pooling using recent mod API additions • Added BillboardUtils class to provide utilites for efficiently rendering billboards in bulk • Added RadialSelectionBox, a generic radial selection menu extending HudCollection • Added GlyphFormat constructor that takes font style enum instead of requiring full Vector2I index • Added tools for rendering polygonal circles & annuli • Added name indexer to BindGroup • Added utility methods to selection boxes to simplify adding entries from internal pools • Added low latency IsChatOpen property to BindManager for input polling • Added IsNewPressed and IsReleased properties to IControl Fixes • Cursor position now continues to update even when not visible • Fixed bugs in textbox causing caret to appear out of position • Fixed out of range exceptions in TextBox • Fixed bug in Dropdown text formatting • Fixed several instances where library UI elements would fail to initialize previous BG and text colors before taking input focus • Fixed bug in ListInputElement affecting selection box types that would prevent it from handling disabled entries correctly • Fixed bug in BindManager where binds would sometimes fail to finish releasing, blocking other inputs Other Changes • Refactored text renderer to render billboards in batches, combined with new pooling system, reducing text draw time by 60-80% • Binds now use EventHandler delegate type for events • Removed candidate bind input filter • Overlapping binds can now be pressed without previously pressed binds being fully released Assets 2 Source code (zip) Source code (tar.gz) 28 Nov 2021 @ZachHembree 1.2.0.1 09918de [1.2.0.1] Fix ScrollBox Min Visible Range Calculation • Fixed bug preventing ScrollBoxes from correctly calculating logical end of visible range when MinVisibleCount property causes it to run over • Moved some library UI elements erroneously placed in server ns Assets 5 Source code (zip) Source code (tar.gz) Font_RichHudFramework.Client.zip (31.56 KB) MinLib_RichHudFramework.Client.zip (152.99 KB) Term_RichHudFramework.Client.zip (74.31 KB) 13 Sep 2021 @ZachHembree 1.2.0.0 02c1347 [1.2.0.0] UI Clipping, Better Cursor and Input Management This is a smaller feature update. Unlike previous versions, this update is focused on adding new core functionality to the UI framework without any significant optimizations or changes to the UI library. Additions: Support for UI clipping. Partially visible elements in scrolling lists, windows, and the like are now clipped instead of simply being set to invisible if they can't fit. Clipping controlled via IsMasking, IsSelectivelyMasked and CanIgnoreMasking properties in HudElementBase ScrollBox and dependent elements now support smooth scrolling Added ToolTips Tooltips are registered with the cursor once every frame on HandleInput Added shared control blacklist to BindManager for disabling the game's built-in binds Controlled via SeBlacklistModes flags. The current version doesn't allow per-control blacklisting. Instead, there are three groups of controls: mouse, camera look, and all binds. Fixes: Slider bars sliders no longer jump to the cursor when clicked Fixed index out of range bug in TextBox when copying/pasting text UI elements will no longer attempt to capture the cursor when they're not visible Other Changes: Scaling properties removed from UI elements in favor of the new ScaledSpaceNode, a type of HUD Space Node. The scaling properties were made redundant in the 1.0 release when I introduced support for custom draw matrices and they were just adding a bunch of complexity and jitteriness for no reason. So, I've removed them. Added a new HighDpiRoot property to HudMain Cursor can now be enabled without requiring chat to be open Text entry still requires chat Added a new InputMode property to HudMain to differentiate between cursor input modes. Removed obsolete fast unregister/reregister for UI elements Now using length 1 array wrappers to minimize copies of draw matrix copies when drawing billboards. Hud Space Nodes and HudMain also now expose these wrapper properties. The things I do in lieu of return by ref...

Tree Optimization In previous versions, update delegates for every node, visible or not, were loaded into the update list on Master. This had the advantage of only requiring the client to update its delegate list when new elements were registered, but with the downside of introducing a constant load, even if nothing was on screen, significantly limiting scalability. Fortunately, there's a simple solution to this problem: just stop trying to load everything at once! Master now rebuilds its update list constantly, and clients (1.1.0.0+) will only register visible elements; any invisible element in the tree will be omitted along with its children, simultaneously eliminating the overhead of invoking update methods for invisible elements and making tree rebuilds/sorting faster by just reducing the size of the collection. This has the consequence of both significantly raising the ceiling for UI complexity while lowering the cost of invisible UI elements to almost nothing. But there is one small snag: the update list on Master doesn't update on every draw tick, it's spread out over 5 ticks, meaning there's a little under 100ms of latency, causing perceptible lag time between making an element visible, and having it actually appear. For most use cases, this isn't an issue, but if you're implementing a scrolling list, you'll need to preload a range of elements before and after the visible range, unless you're okay waiting a few frames for your members to appear in the list. The generic ScrollBox in the UI library does this automatically. Library Overhaul Every non-generic UI element in the library has been reworked to more closely align with the changes to the appearance and function of Space Engineer's UI elements since the Xbox release, and have gained limited support for keyboard input when focused. Selection Box types, like ListBox, TreeBox and Dropdown, for example, by default, allow scrolling and selection using the arrow keys and space bar, in addition to normal mouse input. It's a small detail, but I think it's small details like that that really bring a UI together. And that's another thing: Input Focus. While window focusing functions to bring a window to the foreground, the new input focus functionality determines which element should be accepting keyboard input, usually, the last one clicked/selected. This functionality has been integrated into the MouseInputElement, and by extension, every other element that accepts mouse input. Other Changes: • Selection Boxes: The ListBox, TreeBox, and Dropdown UI elements have been completely reimplemented to improve reliability, appearance and flexibility, and are now all built on a new generic SelectionBox type. In previous iterations, they only supported a single type of entry element; now, they can support custom entry types with arbitrary dimensions, in addition to the more restrictive variants. • Added support for page subcategories to the terminal.

Allows arbitrary IBind definitions to trigger NewPressed/PressedAndHeld/Released events on a specific UI node, optionally requiring input focus. public class BindInputElement : HudNodeBase, IReadOnlyHudNode, IReadOnlyHudParent, IBindInput, IFocusableElement, IEnumerable<IBindEventProxy>, IEnumerable Inheritance object HudParentBase HudNodeBase BindInputElement Implements IReadOnlyHudNode IReadOnlyHudParent IBindInput IFocusableElement IEnumerable<IBindEventProxy> IEnumerable Inherited Members IReadOnlyHudNode.Parent Parent Registered OverlayOffset Register(HudParentBase) Unregister() HudSpace Visible InputEnabled ZOffset Measure() Layout() Draw() InputDepth() HandleInput(Vector2) RegisterChild(HudNodeBase) RemoveChild(HudNodeBase) Examples This example demonstrates how to use a BindInputElement to add keyboard scrolling to a SliderBar. Collection initializer syntax is used to map the LeftArrow and RightArrow directly to handler methods. public static void CreateSlider(HudParentBase parent) { var slider = new SliderBar(parent) { Vertical = false, Min = 0f, Max = 100f, Value = 50f }; var input = new BindInputElement(slider) { // Declarative registration of binds and callbacks CollectionInitializer = { // Format: { IBind, NewPressed, PressedAndHeld, Released (null) } { SharedBinds.LeftArrow, OnSliderLeftArrow, OnSliderLeftArrow }, { SharedBinds.RightArrow, OnSliderRightArrow, OnSliderRightArrow } } }; } private static void OnSliderLeftArrow(object sender, EventArgs e) { // The sender is the InputOwner (the SliderBar), not the BindInputElement var slider = (SliderBar)sender; slider.Value -= 1f; } private static void OnSliderRightArrow(object sender, EventArgs e) { var slider = (SliderBar)sender; slider.Value += 1f; } Alternate Initialization This demonstrates an alternative initialization pattern. Instead of using the collection initializer, the specific IBindEventProxy objects are retrieved using the class indexer. This approach is useful when adding binds dynamically after the object has been constructed or when more explicit syntax is desired. var input = new BindInputElement(slider) { IsFocusRequired = false }; // Retrieve the event proxy for the Left Arrow bind IBindEventProxy leftProxy = input[SharedBinds.LeftArrow]; // Subscribe to events leftProxy.NewPressed += OnSliderLeftArrow; leftProxy.PressedAndHeld += OnSliderLeftArrow; // Retrieve and subscribe for the Right Arrow bind IBindEventProxy rightProxy = input[SharedBinds.RightArrow]; rightProxy.NewPressed += OnSliderRightArrow; rightProxy.PressedAndHeld += OnSliderRightArrow; Remarks BindInputElement functions as a specialized logic node that bridges IBind input with the UI system. Events triggered by this element (such as NewPressed or PressedAndHeld) will only fire if the parent UI node is currently Visible and has InputEnabled set to true.

    "summary": "Class BindManager Namespace RichHudFramework.UI.Client Assembly RichHudClient.dll The central hub for creating and retrieving key binds, control groups, and configuring input blacklisting in the framework. public sealed class BindManager : RichHudClient.ApiModule Inheritance object ModBase.ModuleBase RichHudComponentBase RichHudClient.ApiModule BindManager Examples The following example demonstrates how to initialize a custom IBindGroup, register default key combinations using BindGroupInitializer, and apply previously saved configuration data. IBindGroup allows binds to be retrieved by index or by name. This is convenient for initialization, but error-prone in UI integrations. For this reason, it is recommended to retrieve binds from the group once, and cache their references. public class MyCustomBinds { // Public accessors for specific binds public IBind MenuOpenBind { get; private set; } public IBind ModifierBind { get; private set; } public IBindGroup BindGroup { get; private set; } public MyCustomBinds(IReadOnlyList<BindDefinition> savedConfig = null) { // 1.

Register defaults BindGroup.RegisterBinds(defaults); // 4. Overwrite defaults with saved config (if available) if (savedConfig != null) { BindGroup.TryLoadBindData(savedConfig); } // 5. Store individual bind references for use in the mod MenuOpenBind = BindGroup[\"MenuOpen\"]; ModifierBind = BindGroup[\"Modifier\"]; } } Remarks The BindManager acts as the central factory for the creation, retrieval, and management of key bindings within the Rich HUD Framework. It facilitates the organization of controls into groups, manages the registration of custom input configurations, and handles the suppression of standard game inputs (blacklisting) when necessary. Bind Groups This is the central interface for organizing, initializing, and modifying individual binds. An IBindGroup is a collection of unique, order-independent key combinations, referred to as IBind objects. Groups are created via GetOrCreateGroup. Their names are local to a given mod and must be unique (case-insensitive) within that context. Binds are backed by IControl objects, which provide metadata and allow for dynamic configuration. Binds can be added individually via AddBind or TryRegisterBind, or in batches via RegisterBinds, but they cannot be removed once registered. Note Key binds within an IBindGroup must be unique. While different groups can have overlapping binds, conflicts within a single group are not allowed. Bind names must also be unique within a group (case-insensitive). Initialization Utilities These convenience classes aid in the initialization and registration of binds within a group. BindGroupInitializer: A convenience container used to define the initial state of an IBindGroup. Used in conjunction with RegisterBinds() to batch-register default configurations. It supports combinations of control names, VRage.Input.MyKeys, VRage.Input.MyJoystickButtonsEnum, and RichHudControls. RichHudControls: This is the recommended enum for specifying hard-coded controls, as it unifies keyboard, mouse, and gamepad inputs into a single type for simplicity. UI Integration These components provide the graphical user interface layer for key binding management and event integration. RebindPage: A ready-made GUI for the RichHudTerminal. It provides an interactive user interface for clearing or rebinding keys within IBindGroups registered to that page. BindInputElement: An implementation of IBindInput designed to integrate declarative event-driven input into the UI tree. While IBind provides global input events, BindInputElement ensures events only fire when the specific UI node is visible and input-enabled. This is essential for context-sensitive controls that should not trigger when the UI is hidden or when a different window has focus. Alternatively, binds can be polled manually in HandleInput. Serialization Key binds are not serialized automatically by the framework. It is the responsibility of the mod developer to handle persistence using the following workflow: Save: Before the session unloads, retrieve the current bind definitions using GetBindDefinitions. Write: Serialize these definitions (e.g., to XML) and write them to a configuration file in mod-local storage using WriteFileInLocalStorage. Read: On session initialization, read the file using ReadFileInLocalStorage and deserialize the data. Load: Apply the loaded definitions to the IBindGroup using TryLoadBindData. Bind names should be registered via RegisterBinds before attempting to load deserialized definitions to ensure the group structure exists. Input Blacklisting The framework allows for the suppression of standard game inputs (such as camera rotation or mouse clicks) while UI elements are active. This is controlled via InputFilter, BlacklistMode, or RequestTempBlacklist using SeBlacklistModes flags. Common Use Cases: Disabling camera look while a cursor is visible, intercepting chat input for text fields, or blocking interactions with the game world while a menu is open. Limitations: Blacklisting is not comprehensive; some Space Engineers controls cannot be disabled via the Mod API. Gamepad/Joystick blacklisting functionality may vary. Warning BindManager coordinates blacklisting between mods using the framework to prevent conflicts. Avoid using the native SetPlayerInputBlacklistState API directly, as it may interfere with this system. Fields MaxBindLength The maximum number of controls allowed in a single key bind combination (currently 3). public const int MaxBindLength = 3 Field Value int Properties BlacklistMode Gets or sets the persistent input blacklist mode.

    "summary": "Class HudMain Namespace RichHudFramework.UI.Client Assembly RichHudClient.dll Primary entry point for the client-side UI system. Provides shared access to root UI nodes, cursor, clipboard, screen metrics, and world-space projection utilities. public sealed class HudMain : RichHudClient.ApiModule Inheritance object ModBase.ModuleBase RichHudComponentBase RichHudClient.ApiModule HudMain Remarks HudMain is the entry point for the framework's tree management and update system. It connects individual mod UI subtrees to the Rich HUD Master module, facilitating the creation of a unified and efficient node graph. All UI elements created via the framework must ultimately be attached to one of the provided root nodes to be rendered and processed. This architecture allows for stable, load-order independent layering and seamless depth sorting between different mods. Root: This node represents the standard pixel-space root. Elements attached here map 1:1 with screen pixels. This is useful for manual scaling or fixed-size UI. HighDpiRoot: This node is designed for resolution independence, and is the recommended default for new UI. It automatically applies a scaling factor (ResScale) to its children, ensuring that UI elements maintain a consistent apparent size on high-DPI displays (such as 1440p or 4K monitors) without requiring manual layout adjustments. Update Cycle The framework manages the update logic for the entire node graph to ensure synchronization. Update passes are handled internally, propagating from the root down to leaf nodes. For a detailed explanation of the update cycle (including Measure, Layout, and Draw passes), refer to the documentation for HudElementBase. Input Management The framework creates a unified input environment to handle mouse and keyboard interactions across multiple mods. Shared Cursor: Access to the global cursor is provided via the Cursor property. This interface allows for position querying, tooltip registration, and capture logic. However, direct interaction with the cursor interface is rarely necessary for standard UI components; the framework automatically handles interaction via the IMouseInput interface and the HudSpace. Cursor State: The EnableCursor and RequestCursor properties are used to signal the framework that the mod requests the cursor to be visible. Input Mode: The InputMode property reflects the current state of the input system, indicating whether the cursor is visible or if text input is active. Note EnableCursor does not indicate when the cursor has been enabled through other means, such as by other mods or incidentally by built-in Space Engineers UI. Always check InputMode to determine the actual input state. Coordinate Systems and Metrics While HudMain provides the 2D screen-space roots, the framework allows the definition of custom coordinate systems via HUD Spaces. These allow UI subtrees to be mapped to 3D world coordinates, such as cockpit displays. Refer to the article on HUD Spaces for details. To assist with layout and rendering, HudMain exposes several real-time screen metrics: Screen Dimensions: ScreenWidth, ScreenHeight, and AspectRatio. Scaling: ResScale provides the scaling factor used by the HighDpiRoot, normalized to a 1080p baseline. Projection: PixelToWorld provides the matrix required to convert 2D screen-space coordinates into 3D world-space positions for rendering. Clipboard Integration The ClipBoard property provides a shared, read/write clipboard specific to the framework. This clipboard supports RichText, preserving formatting data (colors and fonts) when copying text between framework controls, such as TextField and TextBox. Note This is separate from the write-only system clipboard API (MyClipboardHelper). Properties AspectRatio The current aspect ratio of the screen, calculated as ScreenWidth / ScreenHeight (e.g., 1.777f for 16:9). public static float AspectRatio { get; } Property Value float ClipBoard The shared clipboard for rich text operations across mods. This allows copying formatted text (including colors, scales, and positions) from one mod's UI and pasting it into another. The is separate from the system clipboard, as access to the real clipboard is write-only. public static RichText ClipBoard { get; set; } Property Value RichText Cursor The shared cursor instance available across all mods. Mods can use this to manually query mouse position, capture/release focus or set tooltips. Direct use of this interface is usually not necessary. IMouseInput already integrates the relevant functionality directly into clickable UI elements. public static ICursor Cursor { get; } Property Value ICursor EnableCursor Enables or disables the shared cursor and switches the input mode accordingly (e.g., from movement controls to UI interaction). Setting this to true shows the cursor and allows mouse input for HUD elements. public static bool EnableCursor { get; set; } Property Value bool Fov The current field of view (FOV) angle in radians, as set by the game's camera settings. public static float Fov { get; } Property Value float FovScale A scaling factor applied to billboard matrix transforms to compensate for changes in apparent size and position due to FOV adjustments public static float FovScale { get; } Property Value float HighDpiRoot The root node dedicated to high-DPI scaling for resolutions exceeding 1080p. This node automatically applies a draw matrix that rescales UI elements to compensate for the reduced apparent size caused by high-DPI displays, maintaining consistent visual sizing. All top-level UI elements added by mods should be parented to this node or Root to function. public static HudParentBase HighDpiRoot { get; } Property Value HudParentBase InputMode The current input mode for the HUD system, indicating whether UI elements should process cursor (mouse) input, text (keyboard) input, or neither. public static HudInputMode InputMode { get; } Property Value HudInputMode PixelToWorld The primary transformation matrix used to convert 2D screen-space coordinates (in pixels) to 3D world-space positions (in meters). This is required for rendering UI in screen space. public static MatrixD PixelToWorld { get; } Property Value MatrixD PixelToWorldRef The primary transformation matrix used to convert 2D screen-space coordinates (in pixels) to 3D world-space positions (in meters). This is required for rendering UI in screen space. public static MatrixD[] PixelToWorldRef { get; } Property Value MatrixD[] ResScale The resolution scaling factor normalized to a 1080p baseline. For resolutions above 1080p, this provides a multiplier (e.g., 2.0 for 4K) to adjust UI sizing. For resolutions at or below 1080p, it returns 1.0f to avoid unnecessary scaling. public static float ResScale { get; } Property Value float Root The root parent node for all client-side HUD elements in the framework. All top-level UI elements added by mods should be parented to this node or HighDpiRoot to function. public static HudParentBase Root { get; } Property Value HudParentBase ScreenDim The current screen dimensions as a Vector2 (ScreenWidth x ScreenHeight) in pixels. public static Vector2 ScreenDim { get; } Property Value Vector2 ScreenDimHighDPI The current screen dimensions (ScreenWidth x ScreenHeight) adjusted for high-DPI scaling by dividing by ResScale, providing normalized coordinates for resolution-independent layouts. public static Vector2 ScreenDimHighDPI { get; } Property Value Vector2 ScreenHeight The current vertical resolution of the screen in pixels, updated every frame. public static float ScreenHeight { get; } Property Value float ScreenWidth The current horizontal resolution of the screen in pixels, updated every frame. public static float ScreenWidth { get; } Property Value float UiBkOpacity The current opacity level (0.0f to 1.0f) for in-game UI backgrounds and menus, as configured in the game's settings.

Layering updates and callbacks are handled automatically in WindowBase. public static byte GetFocusOffset(Action<byte> LoseFocusCallback) Parameters LoseFocusCallback Action<byte> Returns byte GetInputFocus(IFocusHandler) Registers a callback for changes in input focus on UI elements. The callback is invoked whenever another element (e.g., a game menu or different mod UI) takes input focus away from the registered element. Input focus is typically handled automatically in MouseInputElement and standard library UI. public static void GetInputFocus(IFocusHandler handler) Parameters handler IFocusHandler"

Conceptually similar to a CSS Flexbox or a XAML StackPanel, it provides the underlying logic for automatically arranging UI elements without manual pixel positioning. Layout and Sizing The orientation of the stack is controlled by the AlignVertical property. In the framework's terminology, the direction of the stack is the Align Axis (Y for vertical, X for horizontal), while the perpendicular direction is the Off Axis. Layout behavior is further defined by HudChainSizingModes, which determines whether the chain expands to fit its members or clamps them to its own fixed size. Individual elements can be set to fixed sizes or configured to scale proportionally to fill remaining space using the AlignAxisScale property on their containers. Usage and Derivatives While this generic class allows for full customization of container types, the framework includes convenience aliases—HudChain<TElementContainer> and HudChain—which utilize default container and element types for standard use cases. This infrastructure also forms the foundation for scrollable lists, such as ScrollBox<TElementContainer, TElement>, and complex controls like SelectionBoxBase<TChain, TContainer, TElement>. Tip Although the framework does not include a native grid container, complex 2D layouts can be achieved by nesting vertical and horizontal chains.

By pairing child elements with customizable wrapper objects (implementing IHudNodeContainer<TElement>), the collection allows developers to associate metadata or extend functionality without modifying the underlying element. This infrastructure is the foundation for several key layout and control types: HudChain<TElementContainer, TElement>: Uses the collection to implement linear layout logic, organizing elements into vertical or horizontal stacks. Unlike standard parenting, the chain order determines the visual sequence. Chain-specific wrappers (implementing IChainElementContainer<TElement>) introduce layout properties such as AlignAxisScale. These properties work in conjunction with the SizingMode to control the dynamic sizing and alignment of members within the stack. ScrollBox<TElementContainer, TElement>: Builds upon the HudChain architecture to create scrollable regions. It utilizes a specialized container interface that adds an Enabled property. This allows specific entries to be dynamically hidden or shown within the scrolling list without creating layout gaps or removing them from the underlying collection. SelectionBoxBase<TChain, TContainer, TElement>: Extends the collection functionality to support complex interaction patterns and data binding. By implementing interfaces such as IEntryBox<TContainer, TElement>, these types associate UI elements with data tuples (via IScrollBoxEntryTuple and ISelectionBoxEntryTuple) and often integrate object pooling. This flexibility supports the creation of mixed-type lists, where distinct entry types—such as simple labels and folder groups—can coexist within the same structure. A key advantage of this modular design is the decoupling of storage and layout. Because the container logic is generic, a specific control can often be configured to use either a static HudChain or a scrolling ScrollBox by simply changing the generic type argument, while retaining the same entry management logic.

While lighter base classes exist in the node graph, this class represents the minimum requirement for any element that requires definite dimensions and offsets. Parenting and Registration Every UI element must be registered to a parent node to be updated, rendered, or receive input. Registration is normally performed automatically by the constructor, or manually via Register. For an element to be rendered or process input, its hierarchy must ultimately trace back to one of the global root nodes provided by HudMain. Visibility and input handling for registered nodes can be toggled dynamically using Visible and InputEnabled. Update Cycle and Customization This class extends HudNodeBase and HudParentBase, exposing the core update loop hooks required to create custom UI behavior imperatively: Measure: Logic for calculating element dimensions for self-resizing (occurring before the main layout pass). Layout: Logic for arranging child elements, setting finalized sizes, and updating relative positioning. Draw: Logic for rendering the element (e.g., drawing billboards or text). InputDepth and HandleInput: Logic for cursor and keyboard polling. Note Parent nodes can override the sizing of child nodes during layout. Custom UI elements should be designed to respect overrides where practical to ensure stable and correct positioning. Layout and Alignment By default, UI elements are placed relative to the center of the parent node; their Origins are centered. This differs from many UI systems that default to top-left. For UI elements attached directly to one of the root nodes, their position will be relative to the center of the screen. Positioning is set via Offset. This class includes declarative utilities to simplify layout management without requiring manual calculations in the Layout hook: ParentAlignment: Configures the anchoring of the element's Origin relative to its parent. When attached directly to Root or HighDpiRoot, this alignment is clamped to keep the element within screen bounds. DimAlignment: Configures automatic size matching. Elements can be set to match their parent's width, height, or both (with or without padding). By combining these alignment properties with container types like HudChain<TElementContainer, TElement>, complex UI layouts can be constructed without resorting to writing manual layout logic. Input Handling Input can be polled manually, using the HandleInput method seen above, but most standard UI elements have events for value changes, and mouse input events via IMouseInput components. BindInputElement provides events for registering custom IBind presses (created with BindManager) within the context of the UI node. This allows most common input handling to be implemented using only event-driven logic.

    "summary": "Interface IReadOnlyHudSpaceNode Namespace RichHudFramework.UI Assembly RichHudClient.dll Interface for all HUD nodes that define their own custom coordinate space. public interface IReadOnlyHudSpaceNode : IReadOnlyHudParent Inherited Members HudSpace Visible InputEnabled ZOffset Remarks The coordinate system for all UI elements within the framework is defined by the HudSpace property, which uses this interface. Fundamentally, every UI element is rendered on the X/Y (Right/Up) plane of the matrix transform defined by PlaneToWorld. For a comprehensive overview of the concepts regarding coordinate systems in this framework, refer to the article on HUD Spaces. Implementations Several classes implement this interface to provide specific coordinate systems: Root and HighDpiRoot: Managed by HudMain, these are specialized implementations optimized for standard screen-space emulation. CustomSpaceNode: This node offers maximum flexibility by allowing the world matrix to be defined via a delegate callback. It is particularly useful for attaching UI elements to dynamic entities (see: IMyEntity.WorldMatrix) where the transform matrix changes every frame. CamSpaceNode: Generates its coordinate system based directly on the camera matrix. It allows for custom rotation, translation offsets, and optional screen-space scaling, enabling the creation of HUDs that follow the player's view but with specific modifications. ScaledSpaceNode: Modifies an existing HUD space by applying a uniform scalar to the coordinate system. This is primarily used to implement uniform scaling for all child UI elements attached to that node. HudSpaceNodeBase: The abstract base class for most concrete implementations of this interface. It handles the necessary boilerplate for API integration and manages cursor position projection. This ensures that every node within the space's subtree receives accurate cursor coordinates relative to its local coordinate system. Properties CursorPos Position of the HUD cursor projected onto this node's plane. X/Y = local plane coordinates Z = approximate squared distance from the camera to the intersection point (for depth sorting). Vector3 CursorPos { get; } Property Value Vector3 DrawCursorInHudSpace If true, when a child of this node captures the cursor, the cursor will be drawn using this node's PlaneToWorld matrix instead of the default screen-space matrix. Useful for 3D / diegetic UI where the cursor should appear on the custom plane. bool DrawCursorInHudSpace { get; } Property Value bool GetHudSpaceFunc Delegate used by the cursor system to query this node's current HUD space properties.

This pattern is often cleaner than manipulating StringBuilder or RichText objects. public class TextBuilderExample : HudElementBase { private static readonly List<string> values = new List<string> { \"Value 1\", \"Value 2\", \"Value 3\", \"Value 4\" }; private readonly Label textElement; // ... Initialization code ... protected override void HandleInput(Vector2 cursorPos) { // Access the board directly to manipulate the buffer ITextBuilder text = textElement.TextBoard; text.Clear(); // Rebuild the list foreach (string val in values) { text.Append(val); text.Append('\\n'); } } } Example 2: Implementing a Scrollable Text Box This example demonstrates how to wrap a TextBox and a ScrollBar inside a basic HudElementBase. It synchronizes the slider's value with the board's TextOffset. public class ScrollingTextBox : HudElementBase { private readonly TextBox text; private readonly ScrollBar vScroll; private const string LoremIpsum = \"Arbitrary long text...\"; public ScrollingTextBox(HudParentBase parent = null) : base(parent) { text = new TextBox() { AutoResize = false, VertCenterText = false, Text = LoremIpsum, BuilderMode = TextBuilderModes.Wrapped }; vScroll = new ScrollBar() { Vertical = true, // Hook the slider event to update the text offset UpdateValueCallback = OnScrollUpdate }; // Layout: Text takes available width (1f), ScrollBar takes fixed width var layout = new HudChain(this) { AlignVertical = false, DimAlignment = DimAlignments.UnpaddedSize, SizingMode = HudChainSizingModes.FitMembersOffAxis, CollectionContainer = { { text, 1f }, vScroll } }; UnpaddedSize = new Vector2(300, 200); } protected override void Layout() { // 1. Synchronize the slider if the text offset changes externally (e.g., caret movement) vScroll.Value = text.TextBoard.TextOffset.Y; // 2. Calculate the maximum scrollable range (Total Size - Visible Size) float maxOffset = Math.Max(0f, text.TextBoard.TextSize.Y - text.TextBoard.Size.Y); vScroll.Max = maxOffset; // 3. Update the slider handle size to reflect the visible proportion of text if (text.TextBoard.TextSize.Y > 0) vScroll.VisiblePercent = (text.TextBoard.Size.Y / text.TextBoard.TextSize.Y); } // Apply the slider value to the text board's Y offset private void OnScrollUpdate(object sender, EventArgs args) => text.TextBoard.TextOffset = new Vector2(0f, vScroll.Value); } Remarks The ITextBoard interface provides the fundamental rendering and layout logic for UI elements that display text. It acts as a bridge between the raw string manipulation provided by ITextBuilder (which it inherits) and the visual presentation. This interface is the backing component for standard controls such as Label and TextBox. Advanced Formatting and Layout Unlike simple string or RichText properties, ITextBoard exposes granular control over text presentation. It manages line breaking via BuilderMode, vertical alignment via VertCenterText, and dimensions via AutoResize. When AutoResize is disabled, the board clips content that exceeds its FixedSize. Dynamic Text Manipulation Because it extends ITextBuilder, this interface allows for the modification of text without generating significant garbage. Developers can append, insert, or clear text segments efficiently, making it suitable for high-frequency updates (e.g., debug stats or chat logs). It also provides access to structural metadata through ILine and IRichChar. Navigation and Interaction ITextBoard supplies the utilities required for scrolling and click-based navigation: Scrolling: The TextOffset property allows the visible window to be panned across the TextSize. Caret Navigation: MoveToChar calculates the offset required to bring a specific character index into view. Hit Testing: GetCharAtOffset translates a screen-space position into a character index, essential for mouse selection and cursor placement. Note While the text elements in the built-in UI library (like Label) do not include scrollbars by default, ITextBoard provides the underlying infrastructure to implement them manually. See the examples above for a standard implementation pattern. Properties AutoResize If true, the text board's Size will automatically expand or contract to fit the TextSize. bool AutoResize { get; set; } Property Value bool FixedSize The fixed dimensions of the text box used when AutoResize is false. This property is ignored if AutoResize is enabled. Vector2 FixedSize { get; set; } Property Value Vector2 Scale The base visual scale of the text board. This is applied multiplicatively after the scaling specified in GlyphFormat. float Scale { get; set; } Property Value float Size The current boundaries of the text box as rendered. If AutoResize is true, this matches TextSize. If false, this returns FixedSize. Vector2 Size { get; } Property Value Vector2 TextOffset The render offset of the text content (scrolling/panning). Note: AutoResize must be disabled for this to take effect. The value is automatically clamped to ensure the text remains within visible bounds. Vector2 TextOffset { get; set; } Property Value Vector2 TextSize The total dimensions of the text content, including text currently outside the visible range. This value updates immediately upon modification. Vector2 TextSize { get; } Property Value Vector2 VertCenterText If true, the text content will be vertically aligned to the center of the text board. bool VertCenterText { get; set; } Property Value bool VisibleLineRange Returns the index range of the lines currently visible within the text board's bounds. X = Start Line Index, Y = End Line Index. Vector2I VisibleLineRange { get; } Property Value Vector2I Methods GetCharAtOffset(Vector2) Retrieves the index of the character located at the specified local offset. Vector2I GetCharAtOffset(Vector2 localPos) Parameters localPos Vector2 Position relative to the center of the TextBoard. Returns Vector2I The index of the character (X: Line/Char, Y: Column).

    "summary": "Class RichText Namespace RichHudFramework.UI Assembly RichHudClient.dll Reusable rich text builder designed for efficient construction and reuse of formatted text. Internally minimises StringBuilder allocations by merging consecutive text segments that share identical formatting. public class RichText : IEnumerable<MyTuple<StringBuilder, MyTuple<byte, float, Vector2I, Color>>>, IEnumerable, IEquatable<RichText> Inheritance object RichText Implements IEnumerable<MyTuple<StringBuilder, MyTuple<byte, float, Vector2I, Color>>> IEnumerable IEquatable<RichText> Examples Example 1: Dynamic Text Construction The following example shows a reused RichText buffer to construct a formatted string in a loop. This pattern is efficient for text that updates frequently (e.g., every frame in HandleInput). private static readonly GlyphFormat headerFormat = new GlyphFormat(textSize: 1.5f, alignment: TextAlignment.Center); private static readonly GlyphFormat footerFormat = new GlyphFormat(textSize: 0.8f, color: Color.LightGoldenrodYellow); private readonly Label multilineLabel; private readonly RichText buffer = new RichText(); protected override void HandleInput(Vector2 cursorPos) { // Clear the buffer to reuse the internal StringBuilders buffer.Clear(); for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { // Add text with specific styles buffer.Add(\"This is a formatted header\\n\", headerFormat); buffer.Add(\"This is body text that will receive defaulted formatting.\\n\"); buffer.Add(\"This is a formatted footer\\n\", footerFormat); } // Reassigning the buffer updates the UI element's text board multilineLabel.Text = buffer; } Example 2: Declarative Styling This example demonstrates how to use collection initializers to create a static, multi-styled text block. This approach is ideal for help text, tooltips, or static UI labels. // Define reusable formats var headerFormat = new GlyphFormat(textSize: 1.5f, alignment: TextAlignment.Center); var subheaderFormat = new GlyphFormat(textSize: 1.1f, color: Color.LightGoldenrodYellow); var bodyFormat = new GlyphFormat(textSize: 0.9f); // Initialize RichText with a default body format var text = new RichText(bodyFormat) { // 1.

Add a subsection header using the specific format { \"Subsection: This is using subheaderFormat\\n\", subheaderFormat }, // 4. Continue adding body text \"Multi-line text requires the ITextBuilder or Label being written to to be in \", \"the correct mode (Lined or Wrapped) to accept manual line breaks.\\n\" }; Remarks RichText acts as a specialized, reusable string builder designed to facilitate the efficient construction and storage of formatted text. Unlike a standard StringBuilder, this class maintains style information—such as color, font, and alignment—associated with specific text segments. Most text-rendering UI elements within the framework expose properties of this type or provide access to an underlying ITextBuilder (see: Label.Text and Label.TextBoard). To streamline usage, string and StringBuilder instances can be implicitly converted to RichText, allowing plain text to be assigned directly to UI properties without manual conversion. Formatting Behavior Text added to a RichText instance without explicit formatting will inherit style instructions based on the following precedence: If a defaultFormat was specified during construction, that format is applied immediately. If no default was specified, the text remains unformatted until it is assigned to a UI element. Upon assignment, it adopts the default configuration of the target's ITextBuilder. Collection Initializers This class supports collection-initializer syntax. This allows developers to compose complex, multi-styled text blocks declaratively, mixing formatted strings, unformatted strings, and other RichText objects within a single initialization block. Note When retrieving a RichText property from a UI element (e.g., a Label), the accessor returns a deep copy of the content currently stored in the backing ITextBuilder. Modifying this returned instance—via methods like Add()—will not automatically update the UI element. To update the display, the modified instance must be reassigned to the property. Constructors RichText(RichText) Creates a new RichText instance that is a deep copy of the given RichText. public RichText(RichText original) Parameters original RichText The rich text object to copy. RichText(GlyphFormat?) Initializes an empty RichText instance. public RichText(GlyphFormat? defaultFormat = null) Parameters defaultFormat GlyphFormat? Optional default formatting applied to text added without explicit formatting. RichText(string, GlyphFormat?)

Optional default formatting for the text. Fields defaultFormat Default formatting applied to any added text that does not specify its own format.

It configures the container to stack elements vertically and populates it with a variety of standard UI controls, including buttons, sliders, text fields, and a nested list box. var sidebar = new ScrollBox(HudMain.HighDpiRoot) { // Create a vertical scrolling list AlignVertical = true, // Match member width to ScrollBox width SizingMode = HudChainSizingModes.FitMembersOffAxis, // Align to right side of the screen ParentAlignment = ParentAlignments.Right, // Set fixed size Size = new Vector2(300, 400), Padding = new Vector2(40), Spacing = 10, // Nearly anything can go in here CollectionContainer = { new NamedOnOffButton(), new BorderedButton() { MouseInput = { LeftClickedCallback = (obj, args) => { MyAPIGateway.Utilities.ShowMessage(\"ScrollBox Example\", \"Button clicked\"); } } }, new ColorPickerRGB() { Name = \"RGBA Color\" }, new Label() { Text = \"Text Field Label\", AutoResize = false, Height = 20f }, new TextField() { UpdateValueCallback = (obj, args) => { var field = obj as TextField; MyAPIGateway.Utilities.ShowMessage(\"ScrollBox Example\", $\"TextField Updated: {field.Value}\"); } }, new NamedCheckBox(), new ColorPickerHSV() { Name = \"HSV Color\" }, new ListBox<string>() { { \"Key 1\", \"Value 1\" }, { \"Key 2\", \"Value 2\" }, { \"Key 3\", \"Value 3\" }, { \"Key 4\", \"Value 4\" }, { \"Key 5\", \"Value 5\" }, { \"Key 6\", \"Value 6\" }, { \"Key 7\", \"Value 7\" }, { \"Key 8\", \"Value 8\" }, } } }; Remarks ScrollBox is a scrollable variation of HudChain<TElementContainer, TElement>. It maintains the ability to organize child elements into a linear stack—either vertically or horizontally—while constraining them within a fixed viewport. Content that exceeds the defined bounds is clipped by default, and a scrollbar is automatically provided to facilitate navigation through the collection. Unlike a standard chain, this container requires that elements be wrapped in IScrollBoxEntry<TElement> objects. This interface introduces an Enabled state to the container, allowing specific entries to be dynamically hidden or shown within the scrolling list without creating layout gaps or removing them from the underlying collection. This makes the control particularly suitable for filtered lists or large collections of data. Layout and Sizing The control fully supports per-element proportional scaling using AlignAxisScale and automatic sizing behaviors via SizingMode. To determine the visible area of the list, developers should utilize MinLength or MinVisibleCount, or manually assign a fixed size to the element. Usages This class serves as the foundational layout and storage mechanism for higher-level selection controls, including ListBox<TContainer, TElement, TValue> and Dropdown<TContainer, TElement, TValue>.

It combines standardized input handling with a ListInputElement<TElementContainer, TElement> component to deliver core functionality. This includes features such as highlighting, selection management, and entry hiding. The list's layout and scrolling behavior are governed by the generic TChain parameter, which defines the underlying container. This container is typically a HudChain<TElementContainer, TElement> for non-scrolling lists or a ScrollBox<TElementContainer, TElement> for scrollable lists. In both cases, the container manages the collection of elements through a HudCollection<TElementContainer, TElement>. Concrete Implementations To simplify usage, each concrete implementation of SelectionBoxBase provides aliases for its default generic parameters (TElementContainer and TElement). The primary specialization, SelectionBox<TChain, TContainer, TElement, TValue>, forms the basis for selection boxes that use reusable and uniform pooled entries. It offers two main variants based on the container type: ChainSelectionBox<TContainer, TElement, TValue>: The non-scrolling variant. ScrollSelectionBox<TContainer, TElement, TValue>: The scrolling variant. Additional derived types include: ListBox<TContainer, TElement, TValue>: A non-collapsing, scrolling list derived from ScrollSelectionBox. Dropdown<TContainer, TElement, TValue>: A collapsible scrolling list that incorporates ListBox internally. TreeBox<TContainer, TElement>: A non-scrolling, indented, collapsible list suited for heterogeneous, non-pooled entries. TreeList<TContainer, TElement, TValue>: A non-scrolling, indented, collapsible list optimized for uniform, pooled entries.

    "summary": "Custom Textures The framework renders UI elements with the MyTransparentGeometry API. This means custom textures follow the same workflow as other mods that use Transparent Materials: a .dds texture paired with an .sbc definition. Textures are applied to UI elements via a Material handle, which is initialized using the SubtypeId for that texture defined in your .sbc file. For a usage example, see the TexturedBox API reference page. Texture Conversion Textures must be converted to DDS format using BC7_UNORM compression. Other block compression (BC) formats may work, but BC7 is a good default. Use Microsoft’s texconv utility, included with Space Engineers in \\SteamApps\\common\\SpaceEngineers\\Tools\\TexturePacking\\Tools\\texconv.exe. The following batch script examples will convert textures in the same directory to the given format using texconv (drag and drop), provided the batch file, executable and texture are in the same directory. If texconv outputs .DDS (uppercase), rename to lowercase .dds. The engine will complain otherwise. To DDS Batch texconv -y -f BC7_UNORM -pmalpha -if LINEAR %* To PNG Batch You should generally avoid converting from .dds, as it's a highly lossy format. Originals should be kept in a lossless format, like PNG, TIFF, PSD, etc. texconv -y -ft PNG %* Tip For advanced options, see the official texconv documentation. Transparent Material Definitions Create an .sbc for your textures based on the following template. Key Points SubtypeId is the name you’ll reference in code when creating a Material (e.g., new Material(\"MyUniqueSubtypeId\", new Vector2(64))). Texture path is relative to your mod’s root folder. <?xml version='1.0'?> <Definitions xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' xmlns:xsd='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema'> <TransparentMaterials> <!-- Multiple TransparentMaterials can be defined in the same TransparentMaterials block --> <!-- Your first texture --> <TransparentMaterial> <Id> <TypeId>TransparentMaterialDefinition</TypeId> <!-- The name of your texture required by SE and referenced in RHF Material --> <SubtypeId>MyUniqueSubtypeId</SubtypeId> </Id> <!-- Path to your texture, inside your mod directory --> <Texture>MyTexturesFolder\\MyTextureName.dds</Texture> <Reflectivity>0</Reflectivity> </TransparentMaterial> <!-- Your second texture... <TransparentMaterial> ... </TransparentMaterial> --> </TransparentMaterials> </Definitions> Save the file with a .sbc extension (e.g., MyTextureDefinitions.sbc) and place it anywhere inside your mod’s Data folder or its subfolders.

    "href": "articles/HUD-Spaces.html",
    "title": "HUD Spaces | Rich HUD Framework",
    "summary": "HUD Spaces This framework renders all UI elements with textured quads positioned in world space. Each element belongs to a HUD Space Node that defines a 2D plane embedded within the 3D world. Child elements are drawn onto this plane using the node's Plane-To-World (PTW) matrix. By default, UI elements inherit the Pixel-To-World transform provided by HudMain. This transform emulates screen-space rendering: units are in pixels, the origin (0, 0) is at the screen center, and elements appear fixed relative to the viewport. Although the underlying geometry is still world-space billboards (required by the Space Engineers rendering API), this default behavior is functionally equivalent to a 2D screen overlay and is referred to throughout the documentation as “screen space” for simplicity. Space Node Types The framework currently provides three concrete HUD space node implementations: Type Purpose Recommended Use Case ScaledSpaceNode Applies a uniform scale factor to the parent space's XY plane. Simple resizing of screen-space UI (e.g., global UI scaling, high-DPI adjustments) CustomSpaceNode Allows complete control over the PTW matrix via a user-supplied delegate callback every frame Attaching UI to dynamic world entities, fully custom coordinate systems CamSpaceNode Constructs the PTW matrix from the player camera matrix with optional rotation, translation, and scaling View-aligned “floating” HUDs or world-space panels that track the camera If matrix mathematics or coordinate-space transformations are unfamiliar, the Transformations section of LearnOpenGL has an excellent primer. Core Functions Every HUD space node performs three critical tasks each frame: PTW Matrix Calculation – Supplies the transformation that positions and orients its plane in world space. Cursor Projection – Computes the exact world-space point where the mouse cursor intersects the plane, then transforms that point back into the node's local 2D coordinates. This ensures accurate mouse-over detection and input handling regardless of the node's orientation or distance from the camera. Depth Sorting Reference – Provides a representative 3D position (usually the plane origin) used for painter's-algorithm sorting of semi-transparent UI elements. Use Cases HUD Spaces can be divided into two categories of behavior: screen-space and world-space. Screen-Space Emulation Root and HighDpiRoot are pre-configured nodes that place their plane on the camera's near clip plane with pixel units. This is how the framework achieves the illusion of a true 2D overlay despite the API only exposing 3D billboards (see: MyTransparentGeometry). Diegetic / World-Space UI By parenting UI elements to a CustomSpaceNode whose matrix is derived from a cockpit block, door, or any IMyEntity, developers can create interfaces that naturally track objects in the game world (e.g., control panels, status readouts on machinery, holographic menus). Depth Sorting All UI elements are rendered as semi-transparent textured quads. Correct blending order is essential to avoid visual artifacts. The framework sorts entire HUD spaces (not individual elements) by the distance from the camera to each space's origin. Spaces farther away are drawn first; closer spaces are drawn last. This per-space painter's algorithm ensures consistent and predictable transparency behavior even when multiple overlapping world-space HUDs are present. Live Demonstration A demo of CamSpaceNode is available in the Rich HUD Terminal. Enable debugging with the chat command /rhd toggleDebug and open the Demo page to experiment with real-time scaling, rotation, and offset parameters."

    "title": "Installation and Mod Integration | Rich HUD Framework",
    "summary": "Installation and Mod Integration The RHF client should be installed in a preexisting C# mod project. See the official Space Engineers Mod Scripting Reference for details on mod creation. Installation is just a matter of copying the source into your project, and initializing the client: Install the Rich Hud Framework client: Download the latest release from Releases. Copy the Shared and Client folders to /{ModName}/Data/Scripts/{ModName}/RichHudFramework. The final RichHudFramework folder is optional but recommended for organization. Three client variants are available: Full – The complete version included in the main source archive (recommended default). Term – Minimal version containing only the Rich HUD Terminal components. Font – Minimal version containing only the Font Manager. Initialize the client from your mod's primary session component: Add using RichHudFramework.Client;. Call Init during the Init phase of your session component. Initialization may technically occur as early as LoadData(), but Rich HUD Master will not respond until the session's Init phase completes. Add Rich HUD Master as a dependency: Obtain Rich HUD Master from either the Steam Workshop, or by downloading the latest release from GitHub and installing manually. After publishing your mod to the Workshop, add the Workshop version of Rich HUD Master to your mod’s dependency list. Tip The framework is load-order independent. Your UI will function correctly regardless of whether your mod loads before or after RHM. Example If your main class inherits from MySessionComponentBase, a typical implementation will resemble the following: using RichHudFramework.Client; using VRage.Game; using VRage.Game.Components; // Updating is optional for this example [MySessionComponentDescriptor(MyUpdateOrder.NoUpdate)] public sealed class MainModClass : MySessionComponentBase { public override void Init(MyObjectBuilder_SessionComponent sessionComponent) { RichHudClient.Init(DebugName, HudInit, ClientReset); } private void HudInit() { // Registration with Rich HUD Master is now complete. // It is safe to begin using the framework. } public override void Draw() { if (RichHudClient.Registered) { // Perform any external framework updates here, but only after registration. } } private void ClientReset() { // The client has been unregistered and all framework members have stopped functioning. // This callback is invoked in one of three situations: // 1. The game session is unloading. // 2. An unhandled exception occurred on either the client or master side. // 3. RichHudClient.Reset() was called manually. } } In most cases the ClientReset callback can be left empty, as UnloadData() automatically cleans up all resources. Its primary purpose is to notify you of unexpected closure due to the conditions listed above. If you are designing a reloadable mod (one that can be reloaded during an active session), call Reset to unregister the client before reinitializing. Warning When a mod defines multiple session components, initialize the client from only one component. Otherwise, the client will be initialized by whichever component runs Init first, and the HudInit callback will fire only for that component."

ListBox A scrollable list of data-associated text entries. Displaying and allowing selection from a scrolling list of options. TreeList An indented, collapsable list for displaying hierarchical data. Presenting structured, expandable data (like a configuration tree). TreeBox Generalized TreeList that allows arbitrary mixed-type entries. Advanced hierarchies requiring mixed leaf nodes and folder structures. RadialSelectionBox A selection wheel (pie-menu style) displaying entries in a circular pattern. Quick, gesture-based selection in a circular, compact menu. Containers & Layout WindowBase A foundation for creating windows, including header, body, and border framing. Building draggable, resizable dialogs or main interface panels. HudChain A layout container that automatically arranges children in a horizontal or vertical stack. Aligning UI components dynamically without manual coordinate management. ScrollBox A container that clips overflowing content and provides scrollbars for navigation. Presenting long, scrolling content within a confined area. Tip Many of the interactive UI elements above (Toggles, Sliders, and Lists) implement the IValueControl interface. This provides a unified way to interact with controls that hold a changing value using events. Input Handling Elements These are non-visual elements that provide core functionality for key binds and mouse interaction with your visible UI Elements. Name Description Use Case BindInputElement A utility for mapping custom keybinds or control combinations to UI elements. Defining custom keyboard shortcuts or gamepad button presses that trigger specific actions on a focused UI element. MouseInputElement The foundational component for processing cursor interactions (clicks, hover states, tooltips). Adding mouse interactions (clickable/hoverable) to UI elements that lack them and enabling tooltips."

    "summary": "Overview The Rich HUD Framework is a modding library enabling the creation of fully custom, retained-mode Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) within Space Engineers C# mods. RHF provides the essential architecture for building scalable, layered, and interactive user interfaces within the constraints of the Space Engineers modding API. It does this by offering: Declarative UI: A library of standard controls (buttons, dropdowns, sliders) that minimizes boilerplate code and facilitates a declarative approach to UI construction. Extensive Customization: Flexibility for imperative design and deep customization via subclassing. API Enhancements: It fills critical gaps in the modding API by including: A system for managing key binds. A custom, flexible text renderer. Get Started Ready to jump into the code? Installation: See the article on Installation and Mod Integration. Example: Explore a practical application in the Text Editor Example repository. For general Space Engineers modding reference, consult the official Space Engineers Wiki. The Node Graph At the heart of the framework is a retained-mode UI tree. Unlike immediate-mode GUI systems where elements are defined and drawn every frame, elements in this framework are persistent objects in memory, organized into a hierarchy of parents and children. Core Principles Hierarchy: Every UI element must be attached to a parent node to be rendered or processed. The update cycle propagates from the root down to leaf nodes. Retained-Mode: Elements are objects that persist across frames, which allows the framework to efficiently manage state and updates. Coordinate Spaces and Scaling Coordinate Spaces: The framework supports both screen-space rendering (2D overlays) and world-space rendering (3D displays attached to in-game entities). This is managed through HUD Spaces, which allow any subtree to be attached to a custom coordinate space driven by an arbitrary world matrix. Resolution Independence: The optional HighDpiRoot node scales UI elements to maintain consistent sizing for screen-space UI across different resolutions (e.g., 1080p vs. 4K). HudMain is the entry point for the client-side UI system. From here, you access the root nodes, screen metrics, and the shared cursor. Hierarchy Example Root // Screen-sized container, no DPI scaling ├── HighDpiRoot // Automatically handles DPI and resolution scaling │ └── HudChain // Layout manager (e.g., vertical stack) │ └── { Label, Button, TextField } // Child elements └── TexturedBox // Background └── Label // Text draws over TexturedBox UI Elements HudElementBase is the practical starting point for modded UI. Each element has explicit size and padding, supports parent-relative or offset positioning, offers built-in alignment modes (ParentAlignment and DimAlignment), and exposes update hooks required for deep customization. Complex layouts can be built declaratively using chains, collections, and alignment properties – often without writing any manual positioning code. Nested horizontal/vertical HudChain instances serve a similar role to CSS Flexbox or WPF StackPanel, while ScrollBox adds scrolling capability. TexturedBox and Label are the simplest concrete types in the framework, providing basic textured quad and text rendering, respectively. These can serve as a good starting point when learning how to initialize visible UI. Note While the framework includes several pre-built elements, more sophisticated custom UIs will often require extending HudElementBase or other descendants directly to implement custom layout and input logic. See the API reference for HudElementBase for details. Input & Key Binds The BindManager serves as the central hub for handling user input. It facilitates the creation of custom key binds and control groups that can be serialized for persistence. Grouped Binds: Inputs are organized into groups to prevent conflicts. Aliasing: Each bind supports primary, secondary, and tertiary key combinations (aliases). Blacklisting: The manager handles the suppression of standard game inputs (such as camera rotation or shooting) while UI elements are interactive, preventing accidental interactions with the game world. The Settings Menu To streamline mod configuration and promote a more consistent user experience, the framework provides a shared settings menu (RichHudTerminal). Rather than rely on chat commands, manually-edited config files, or a bespoke GUI, you can register controls within this terminal and tie it into your own configuration system with simple event callbacks. Mods contribute pages and controls via a simple container hierarchy: Control pages with sliders, checkboxes, dropdowns, etc. Dedicated ready-made rebind pages. Read-only rich-text pages for help/changelog content. Text Renderer The framework includes a custom bitmap text renderer (exposed via ITextBoard), which supports custom fonts and is suitable for everything from a one-line plain text field to multi-line wrapped rich text. Label: The standard, non-interactive UI element used for displaying text. It serves as the main entry point for the text renderer for simple text fields. RichText: This class allows for the construction of formatted text strings where style, color, and size can vary per character. The FontManager allows mods to register and use custom texture-based fonts at runtime. See the article on Custom Fonts for details."
